# ipay
A simplified payment system with many integrations for the PZX ESDT token. It includes several features such as:

Payment via QR code,
Insights into transactions,
Quick payment verification/signatures,
Payment via short usernames (instead of wallet addresses),
Developer and user friendly mini apps within the main app,
AI tools,
Marketplaces,
Account Recovery and sharing,

This github repo contains mostly example apps (which can be integrated into iPay minis), payment infrastructure for dApps (soon) and login with iPay code. It also contains select iPay minis, so you can have a look at the code and make your own version.
