# ipay
A simplified payment system with many integrations for the PZX ESDT token, as well as most functions of the MultiversX blockchain. It includes several features such as:

Payment via QR code,
insights into transactions,
quick payment verification/signatures,
payment via short usernames (instead of wallet addresses),
developer and user friendly mini apps within the main app,
AI tools,
marketplaces,
wallet recovery and sharing,
a stock and token exchange,
evergrowing databases and infrastructure 
and much more

This github repo contains mostly example apps (which can be integrated into iPay minis), payment infrastructure for dApps (soon) and setup for Login w/ iPay. It also contains select iPay minis, so you can have a look at the code and make your own version.
